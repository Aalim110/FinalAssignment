# Abstract:

A dsitributed system is continuously evolved in changes according to enviroment so we adapt system of systems to understand software.This paper presents a conceptual methodology for selecting existing systems to form candidate systems of systems (SoS) and selecting the preferred candidate SoS to provide a new capability. This methodology begins with SoS acquisition and mission requirements and selects the preferred SoS in six steps. Decision factors used for this purpose are selected based on their importance in providing and sustaining the required SoS capability. A new index of priority is introduced and utilized in this methodology to compare candidate systems, in terms of their assigned mission priority, with respect to the SoS mission priority, as well as their contribution to the SoS mission.  In the last decades, the use of ontologies in information systems has become more and more popular in various fields, such as web technologies, database integration, multi agent systems, natural language processing, etc. Artificial intelligent researchers have initially borrowed the word “ontology” from Philosophy, then the word spread in many scientific domain and ontologies are now used in several developments.

# Introduction:
Computer system are evovled in the basic pictures of connected PCS to inter connected PCS of heterogenous system. .Each of these systems contains a set of heterogeneous components that implement diverse functions communicating using different protocols.Further more,these various systems often need to interact and collaborate to achieve their goals.For example,isolated rescue teams need to opportunistically compose and access each others services(e.g.,datalook-up)to exchange information; deployed environmental IoT systems process their data on a micro cloud in their vicinity and off load certain processing to the cloud when needed; etc. In this sense, larger systems are constructed through the interaction of smaller ones,a practice known as System of Systems (SoS) composition.Heterogenity and scale pose significant challenges to SoS construction. Developers need knowldege to construct SoS. A number sub systems combined to make a system of system it is a complex system. SoSs are typically deployed in environments where context changes.This is where the need arises to veerfromastrict work flow path that has been defined at design time,and form a more complex system in order to maintain the intended abstract behavior or to be able to provide new behavior that is only possible through uniting with other systems in the new context.Such examples include disaster recovery,adaptive IoT applications,volunteer and crowd computing, military defense operations, and other forms of cyber physical systems.Further more,the development of SoS is dynamic in nature.This is grounded in the knowledge that systems are persistent and long-living. As such, their objectives and functionalities evolve over time as they are constantly added,modified,or removed at different time scales.This might also predicate changes in architectural and functional dependencies. An example of ontology is when a physicist establishes different categories to divide existing things into in order to better understand those things and how they fit together in the broader world. ... Whereas the World Wide Web links Web pages together, the Semantic Web links the data on the Web that are related. In order to achieve this objective,there is a need for semantics to comprehensively describe the system structure,capturing the information required for dynamically composing systems such as those relating to communication(e.g.,unique identifiers),service discovery,quality of service,physical properties(e.g.,powerlevel and location),environmental properties,etc.We refer to this comprehensive structure description of a system as a holon. A holon is constantly modified to reflect the system structure and to contain any new or modified information,and then published to aid discovery and reasoning about composition.When holons compose,they form a new holon that represents the SoS.This newlyc onstructed holon will now have its own specification,which is published so that thee system can further compose with other SoSs and soon. The service composition supported by SOA is mainly functionality based composition.How ever,SoS composition is wider than this,as it also requires knowledge about system properties and context to reason about the composition.Second,services in SOA are assumed to be published in a repository that an orchestrator can consult to select services from.This assumption is not valid in the general SoS context which is fully distributed.Third,SOA-based SoS developers are expected to know alot about individual systems,or invest significant time learning them.   Developers are required to acquire knowledge about the APIs and properties of the elementary systems they need to compose.Then, they need to leverage that knowledge to design and implement the SoS,and finally deploy it.This requires the developer to focus on the elementary systems instead of the whole SoS.

# Problem Space and Related Work:
This paper presents an approach to system-of-systems engineering for product development with the use of ontology. A proposed method for building as well as using ontology to generate and explore system-of-systems design spaces based on identified system-of-system needs is presented. The method is largely built to cover the first levels of related work, where a process for system of systems in the context of product development is introduced. Within this work, it is shown that scenarios for a system-of-systems can be used to identify needs and subsequently the system-of-systems capabilities that fulfils them. The allocation of capabilities to possible constituent systems is used to show the available design space. The proposed method of this paper therefore addresses these initial challenges and provides a framework for approaching the system-of-systems design space creation using ontology. A case study is used to test the method on a fictitious search and rescue scenario based on available resources and information from the Swedish Maritime Administration. The case study shows that a representation of a system-of-systems scenario can be created in an ontology using the method. The ontology provides a representation of the involved entities from the fictitious scenario and their existing relationships. Defined ontology classes containing conditions are used to represent the identified needs for the system-of-systems. The invocation of a description logic reasoner is subsequently used to classify and create an inferred ontology where the available system-of-systems solutions are represented as sub-classes and individuals of the defined classes representing the needs. Finally, several classes representing different possible system-of-systems needs are used to explore the available design space and to identify the most persistent solutions of the case study.

# RESEARCH STRATEGY:

Based on the above, our ultimate goal is to shift the developers’ focus from learning the internals of elementary systems to thinking at the level of the SoS. As shown in Fig. 1, holons allow developers to focus on defining high-level workflows of the SoS. The elementary systems need to autonomously discover each other and compose to serve the requests.The achievement of this goal requires (1) a comprehensive description of the atomic systems (their services, properties, and context) that enable autonomous composition between systems;

and (2) an architecture the exploits such descriptions and supports SoS composition and adaptation.

# 4 THE HOLONIC LIFE CYCLE: 
A holon starts as an atomic one then might evolve to being composite. An atomic holon represents a single system that provides one or more functionalities.A composite holon includes functionalities provided by a number of systems interacting with eachother either directly or through others. In order for holons to compose, atomic holons need to be comprehensively specified by the system developer.After that,the system will be dynamically constructed as the holons iterate in their lifecycle.The four stages of a holon’s life cycle:

## Specification:
A system developer uses an ontology to create the holon from a number of elementary descriptions.This includes a holon identifier,the physical properties of the system(e.g.,power level),quality of service(e.g.,availability and reliability),environmental properties(e.g., location),policies(e.g., routingprotocol), services (e.g., sensing temperature), among others. All these are specified using our ontological model.

## Dissemination:
A created holon disseminates its specification so it can be discovered. Different dissemination strategies can be adopted: push, pull, and lookup. In the push strategy, the holon periodically broadcasts its latest description. In contrast, a pull strategy uses heartbeat signals; i.e., the holon periodically sends ‘Hello’messages to establish interaction with other systems,which could then request the full holon description.This strategy reduces overhead,so isuseful in energy-constrained environments.Inthe lookup strategy,the holon registers its description with a registry that can be consulted by other systems to obtain the holon.This strategy is to be used when infra structure assistance is guaranteed. We adopt the push strategy for the scope of this paper.

## Compilation:
This aims at understanding other holons and their functionalities.This is achieved by parsing received descriptions (in the form of XML representations), and identifying the functionalities contained within,and how they interact with that of the received holon.Compiling these functionalities into one holon representing a new SoS comprising of the interacting holons. 

## Modification

Holons can change at run time due to a changein the physical system(e.g.,update of a service)or due to a structural change(e.g.,composition to a new holon).In either case,the holon description will be modified to reflect the change.Upon obtaining a modified version of a holon,the receiving holon will re compile its own holon and disseminate it.This will convey the changes to the whole SoS.

# The Ontological Model:
Ontology model allows structure information as well as to raises the effectiveness of search. Research describes the development of ontology models for engineering knowledge in Internet portal and modeling system for the classification and recognition of marine objects. For a holon to be able to compose with another holon at run time,it needs to advertise its own definition in a systematic way that can be easily understood by the receiving holon.For this,the definition needs to embody the different concepts surrounding the holon, triggering the need for an appropriate structure to representit. In this respect,an ontology seems to be  the best technique to capture the definition and behavior of a holon.Anontology is a formal and explicit specification of a shared conceptualization. It models some aspect of the world (called a domain), and provides a simplified view of certain phenomena in this domain. The description of the domain is based on a vocabulary that explicitly defines its concepts, properties,relations,functions,and constraints. 

For our purposes, the ontology will be used by a holon to advertise its services,the types of input parameters requiredforsaid services,and the types of outputs they produce,if any.Further more, the ontology isused to identify the physical properties of the holon such as the power level(infinite/finite),location,operating system, mobility,etc. Whilst an entirely new ontology can be developed from scratch, we deemed it more constructive to look at existing ontologies and extend suitable ones, i.e., the ones that contain the semantics required to describe holons,if and where necessary. In order to identify the most appropriate ontology to represent holons,we looked at different sensor and observation ontologies.We started with those surveyed by th eW3C Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) In cubator Group,and continued with our own study of others.  Based on this investigation,the ontologies that we found suitable for extension are(in chronological order):CoDAMOS,Swamo, A3ME, and Ontonym. We concluded to use CoDAMOS  due to its inherent predis position for modification, making it easily extensible for defining context-aware computing infra structures varying from small embedded devices to high-end service platforms. Further more,CoDAMOS’sconcepts closely match the kind of definitions we want to create for a holon. For example, the Service concept- i.e., having a service pro file-can be used to define the types of services provided or required by a holon.Note,however, that this doesnot imply that the other short listed ontologies cannot be used.Indeed,A3ME (to pick just one other ontology)could be merged with CoDAMOS to describe further concepts related to holonic design;for instance,the API Public CoDAMOS concept can be further described as Global Address,Local Address,or Other Address usingtheAddress concept of A3ME. For this paper,we use CoDAMOS as the basis ontology wit hthe aim of answering our research questions.

# Extensions:
Extensions shows the type of file that wich type of file is and which language is related this file extension gives us look of file.

 # Application:
 For demonstration, we show how two holons can be composed using their underlying description. As such,the starting pointis where each holon defines it self using the ontology:its properties, the services it provides, and the parameters being used. These descriptions are broadcasted by each respective holon. On receiving such broadcast, holons will compose with each other if they meet the criteria for composition, for instance: if a holon H1 is requiring a service X, and it encounters another holon H2 that is providing such service, then H1 can initiate the composition procedure wit hH2.Once H1 gets composed wit hH2,it needs to update its definition to reflect its new state as a composed holon, i.e., a SoS,that is now providing serviceX.This update is carried out at run time through creating an instance of the holon concept(called,say,H3)to represent the new holon that has been encountered,and it also holds the definition of H2 in this case. Moreover,the ontology retains the ability to infer new knowledge based on the domain in formation provided.For example,there is a defined concept called composed Holon that is used to identify whether a holon is a simple or compose done. In this context,given that a holon has been composed to another holon, the ontology reasoner can determine whether this holon is a compose done.If H2 gets out of reach,then the ontology of the composed H1 will be updated to accommodate this change,simply by removing the H3 instance and clearing composed Holon.

# SOS Construction Model:
This section involves holonic ontologies to compose SOS runtime and in construction of SOS role of holonic ontologies.

# Composition Model:
Each holon needs to build a model that represents its awareness about the existence of other holons (i.e., systems) and their services.This model(called the compositio nmodel)is used to interact (compose)with the other systems by accessing their services.The composition model of a holon is represented as a weighted tree T rooted by the holon and with a depth of three. The children of the root are the holons that are directly reachable by the root holon. The leaf nodes represent the detected functionalities that are provided by or accessed through the children holons. Each leaf node i is assigned a weight that represents the cost of accessing the corresponding functionality Fi. For simplicity, in this paper we define the cost as the distance between the root and the holon providing Fi in terms of the number of intermediate holons.Other cost functions such as delay, reliability or aggregated Quality of Service(QoS)canals obe used. It is worth mentioning that a holon is not aware where a functionality Fi islocated.However,the holon is aware of the cost of accessing Fi and through which holon can Fi be accessed.
The compositio nmodel is frequently updated during the lifecycle of the holon.Updates include adding/ removing new holon branches, and updating the services of current ones. Adding and updating are performed upon receiving holon ontologies,while removing is carried out if the ontology is not received during a certain time period (we setthis to be three times the dissemination period)
