# Abstract:

A dsitributed system is continuously evolved in changes according to enviroment so we adapt system of systems to understand software.This paper presents a conceptual methodology for selecting existing systems to form candidate systems of systems (SoS) and selecting the preferred candidate SoS to provide a new capability. This methodology begins with SoS acquisition and mission requirements and selects the preferred SoS in six steps. Decision factors used for this purpose are selected based on their importance in providing and sustaining the required SoS capability. A new index of priority is introduced and utilized in this methodology to compare candidate systems, in terms of their assigned mission priority, with respect to the SoS mission priority, as well as their contribution to the SoS mission.  In the last decades, the use of ontologies in information systems has become more and more popular in various fields, such as web technologies, database integration, multi agent systems, natural language processing, etc. Artificial intelligent researchers have initially borrowed the word “ontology” from Philosophy, then the word spread in many scientific domain and ontologies are now used in several developments.

# Introduction:
Computer system are evovled in the basic pictures of connected PCS to inter connected PCS of heterogenous system. .Each of these systems contains a set of heterogeneous components that implement diverse functions communicating using different protocols.Further more,these various systems often need to interact and collaborate to achieve their goals.For example,isolated rescue teams need to opportunistically compose and access each others services(e.g.,datalook-up)to exchange information; deployed environmental IoT systems process their data on a micro cloud in their vicinity and off load certain processing to the cloud when needed; etc. In this sense, larger systems are constructed through the interaction of smaller ones,a practice known as System of Systems (SoS) composition.Heterogenity and scale pose significant challenges to SoS construction. Developers need knowldege to construct SoS.
