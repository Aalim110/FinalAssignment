# Abstract

>In past time several automated statrgies have been proposed to fix bugs without any human intervention.
There describes how to resolve issues regarding system levels.These failures are common complex systems.
Here in this paper authors proposed a repair technique to automatically resolve undesired feature interaction failures in (ADS).

### Some repair startgies are:

1.Localizing faults spanning several lines of code

2.Simultaneously resolving multiple interactionfailurescausedbyindependentfaults

3.scaling repair strategies from the unit-level to the system-level

4.)resolving failures based on their order of severity 


## Introduction

>Automated driving system is often several units of functionality features known as ADS that automate specify driving tasks e.g Emergency brakes,traffic light cruise control and Artificial intelligence should also b envolved to know the enviroment information such as pedestarian speed,position of the car road structure lanes.This information should be useful for ADS feature to know car maneuver.Cruise control feature control car acceleratin speed while at the same time traffic recognization features helps to stop car when traffic light turn red.Some integrations rules are applied to resolve maneuver conflicts.Integrations rules provide us that which feature should be priortized according to condition such cruise control for speed traffic light recognization for traffic.The should should be come in contact with system after measuring enviroment information.Integration rules tend to diffuclt as they should provide large numbers of enviroment traffic light recognization.There needs to assist engineers as they repair integration rules for every situation they priortize maneuver that can ensure ADS saftey.
